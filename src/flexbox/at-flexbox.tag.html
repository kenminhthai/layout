/**
 * an attribute-based layout element based on flexbox.
 *
 * note, this element does nothing that cannot be done via the flexbox attributes alone;
 * in most cases a more appropriate/semantic element should be used.
 * it exists here mainly for completeness and as a way for other elements to express dependencies.
 *
 * options for flex containers:
 * @opts string flexbox        a space-separated list of layout options:
 *  - wrap|reverse               specifies flex-wrap value; defaults to 'none'
 *  - end|center|between|around  specifies justify-content value; defaults to 'start'
 *  - inline                     makes the flex container display inline; defaults to 'flex'
 *  - row|column                 sets the flex container's main axis; defaults to 'row'
 *  - reverse                    reverses the main axis
 *                               (column-reverse if 'column' is set; row-reverse otherwise)
 *  - gutter                     adds a margin between each of the container's flex items
 * @opts string flex-items     a space-separated list of default display properties for flex-items:
 *  - start|end|center|baseline  sets default alignment; defaults to 'stretch'
 *  - grow                       sets items to grow as needed; defaults to 'none'
 * @opts string flex-contents  sets cross-axis alignment of flex-items
 *                             (one of start|end|center|between|around; defaults to 'stretch')
 *
 * options for flex items (which may be flex containers also):
 * @opts string item-align  a space-separated list of display options:
 *  - start|end|center|baseline|stretch  sets item's self-alignment;
 *                                       defaults to container's `flex-items` value (if set) or 'stretch'
 *  - 1|2|3|4|5                          sets the item's display order; defaults to source order
 * @opts int item-grow      sets the item to grow (1) or shrink (-1); defaults to neither (0)
 *
 * @yields  to tag root; direct child elements become flex-items
